# Alapatch

Alapatch is a Patch Editor for the KORG microKorg Synthesizer, that allows you to design patches in a web editor with an easy to use GUI.

Alapatch currently only supports loading and saving patch files in the .SYSEX format used internally in the microKORG, however future support for the .plg format may be a possibility. (because it needs to be reverse engineered still.)
